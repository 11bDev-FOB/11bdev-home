# Sitrep Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Sitrep (Situation Report) page is an activity feed that aggregates and displays activity from:
- GitHub organization (11bDev-FOB) - both public and private repos
- X/Twitter feed (@11bdev with #11bdev hashtag)

## Features
âœ… Fetches GitHub events (commits, PRs, issues, new repos)
âœ… Caches data in the database to avoid constant API calls
âœ… Beautiful, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
âœ… Activity grouped by date
âœ… Metadata display (repo names, commit counts, stars, etc.)
âœ… Manual refresh button
âœ… Supports both public and private repos with GitHub token
âœ… Automatic cleanup of old items (30+ days)

## Access
- **URL**: `/sitrep`
- **Navigation**: Added to main navigation menu

## Configuration

### GitHub Token (Required for Private Repos)
Your GitHub token is stored in `.env`:
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

**Token Permissions Required:**
- `repo` - Full control of private repositories
- `read:org` - Read org and team membership

### Twitter/X API (Optional)
To enable X feed integration, add to `.env`:
```bash
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## Usage

### Manual Refresh
Click the "ðŸ”„ Refresh Feed" button on the Sitrep page, or use:
```bash
bin/rails runner "RefreshSitrepJob.perform_now(days: 7)"
```

### Rake Tasks
```bash
# Refresh sitrep data
rake sitrep:refresh

# Test GitHub API connection
rake sitrep:test_github
```

### Automated Refresh
For production, set up a cron job or use a scheduler like `whenever` gem:
```bash
# Refresh every hour
0 * * * * cd /path/to/app && bin/rails runner "RefreshSitrepJob.perform_now(days: 7)"
```

Or add to your deployment with Solid Queue recurring jobs.

## Database Schema
```ruby
create_table :sitrep_items do |t|
  t.string :item_type      # 'github' or 'twitter'
  t.string :title          # Display title
  t.text :content          # Content/description
  t.string :url            # Link to original item
  t.string :external_id    # Unique ID (prevents duplicates)
  t.datetime :published_at # When the activity occurred
  t.json :metadata         # Additional data (repo name, stars, etc.)
  t.timestamps
end
```

## Architecture

### Services
- `GithubActivityService` - Fetches GitHub org activity
- `TwitterFeedService` - Fetches X posts (when configured)

### Jobs
- `RefreshSitrepJob` - Background job that fetches and caches data

### Models
- `SitrepItem` - Stores cached activity items

### Controllers
- `SitrepController` - Displays the feed and handles refresh requests

## Docker Deployment
The app is already configured for Docker deployment per your rules. When deploying:

1. Make sure to set environment variables in your deployment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   # Or with docker run:
   docker run -e GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token ...
   ```

2. For production, consider using Docker secrets or environment files

## What Data is Fetched?

### From GitHub (Both Public & Private):
- Push events (commits)
- Pull requests (opened, merged, closed)
- Issues (opened, closed)
- New branches/tags
- Repository updates

### From X/Twitter (when configured):
- Posts from @11bdev containing #11bdev
- Engagement metrics (likes, retweets)

## Privacy & Security
- âœ… `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- âœ… Token has restricted file permissions (600)
- âœ… API calls are cached to minimize exposure
- âœ… Old data is automatically cleaned up after 30 days

## Troubleshooting

### No GitHub data showing?
```bash
# Test the connection
rake sitrep:test_github

# Check token is set
bin/rails runner "puts ENV['GITHUB_TOKEN'].present? ? 'Token found' : 'No token'"
```

### Rate limits?
GitHub API rate limits:
- Without auth: 60 requests/hour
- With auth: 5,000 requests/hour

The app caches data to minimize API calls.

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Auto-refresh every hour via Solid Queue
- [ ] RSS feed export
- [ ] Filter by repo or activity type
- [ ] Discord webhook integration
- [ ] Email digest option
