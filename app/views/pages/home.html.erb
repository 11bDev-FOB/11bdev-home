          Look, I spent time in the Army. I know what "mission-first" really means. So when I started seeing how much tech just gets in the way, I had to fix it. I build the simple, clean tools that cut the crap and simplify your mission. No billion-dollar venture funding, just effective software built to help you adapt and overcome.

            We build products we actually wanted for ourselves. No fluff, no BS, no "revolutionary" to-do lists.

      Still here? Outstanding. Look, we had each other's backs downrange—didn't matter 
      if you were Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, or from some other country entirely. 
      That brotherhood doesn't end when you hang up the uniform. The tech world's full of 
      egos and BS, but some of us still believe in covering your six and building tools 
      that actually work. Hoorah, Oorah, Hooah—whatever you said back in the day.
