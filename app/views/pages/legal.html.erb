          <p>
            These are free, open-source projects built by one caffeinated developer who got tired of seeing overcomplicated software everywhere. They're not backed by corporations, venture capital, or a legal team.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold">
            Translation: These are tactical hobby projects made with love, not lawyers. 💙

        <ul class="text-gray-600 space-y-2 list-none">
          <li>• Things might break. Sometimes spectacularly. 💥</li>
          <li>• Features might disappear. Or get completely rewritten overnight.</li>
          <li>• Data might get lost. Back up anything important.</li>
          <li>• The server might go down. Because infrastructure needs maintenance.</li>
          <li>• APIs might change. Third parties love to move the goalposts.</li>
